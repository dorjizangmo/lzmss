        <p>In 1970, a group of India House ladies used the rooms of the Government Guest House, at Lungtenzampa to organize a nursery classes for some of their children. They also invited Bhutanese children to play sessions. The ladies did this on a voluntary basis, whenever they were free.</p>
        <br>The school was upgraded to High School in the year 2001 and it was welcomed by the staff, students and parents, as it was perceived as recognition of the teachersâ€™ commitment and capability to shoulder a larger responsibility. It inspired the teachers to work harder to prove themselves worthy of the trust placed in them by the Department of education.
